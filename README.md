# National Disaster Response Management System

## Overview
The **National Disaster Response Management System** is a team database design and management project for INFO 330: Databases and Data Modeling (December 2024). It provides a structured way to manage data related to disasters, including resources, response teams, financial aid, public health data, and incident reports. 

### Key Features
- **Centralized Data Management**: Organizes disaster information in a relational database.
- **Comprehensive Entity-Relationship Model**: Ensures normalized and efficient data organization.
- **Advanced Querying**: Supports in-depth analysis with various SQL techniques (e.g., joins, aggregates, ranking).
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle multiple disaster scenarios, locations, and data types.

### Target Audience
- **Disaster Management Agencies**  
- **Public Health Departments**  
- **NGOs and Relief Organizations**  
- **Academic Researchers and Analysts**  

## Usage
1. **Basic Queries**  
   - Perform SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations on the relevant tables.
   - Retrieve information on disaster statuses, financial aid totals, resource allocation, etc.
2. **Advanced Queries**  
   - Use joins and aggregations to create detailed analytics (e.g., summing total aid per disaster).
   - Apply ranking queries to compare hospitalizations or other metrics across different disasters.
3. **Reporting and Analysis**  
   - Generate reports for various stakeholders: counts of disasters by year, response team deployments, outbreak tracking, and more.
   - Incorporate the queries into a dashboard or reporting tool for real-time insights.

## Project Structure
- **Database Scripts**: Contains the SQL scripts for table creation and sample data insertion.
- **Documentation**: Provides an overview of the entity-relationship diagram (ERD) and how entities interconnect.
